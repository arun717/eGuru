Install your Plugin to Eclipse

Right-click your plugin project in Package Explorer window.

Press Export... in shown context menu.

Select Plug-In Development -> Deployable plug-ins and fragments (or Deployable plug-ins and fragments directly in old Eclipses).

Use it to get plugin JAR file, i.e. org.plugin.helloworld_1.0.0.201504042200.jar

Close Eclipse. 

Put the JAR in a folder named dropins/eclipse/plugins under your target eclipse directory.

Run Eclipse again.

Now you'll see "Sample Menu" with "Sample Action" item on ever Eclipse run.

Note: You can write an automatic installer for your plugin for Windows users, or publish your plugin to... the Eclipse Marketplace! :))
