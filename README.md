eGuru: hosted over e-Mentoring Platform

The tool consists of a Team Dashboard that helps teachers to organise the students into teams and mentor them effectively.

When a student (working on a team project hosted over GitHub) connects with the server, he/she sends the URL of the GitHub repository to the server. 

The server stores the team information and team member information in a MySQL database.
